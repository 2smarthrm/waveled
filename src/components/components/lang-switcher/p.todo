If you want HTML (as a string) → PDF in Node.js with CSS preserved, these are the go-to libraries:
Best options (full styling support)
1) Playwright (recommended)


Renders HTML using a real headless browser (Chromium/WebKit/Firefox).


Supports modern CSS very well (flex, grid, web fonts, etc.).


You generate PDF via page.pdf().


2) Puppeteer


Similar approach (headless Chrome/Chromium).


Very common for HTML-to-PDF with accurate styling.


“Good, but not 100% CSS” options
3) wkhtmltopdf (via Node wrapper)


Uses an older WebKit engine, so some modern CSS can be hit-or-miss.


Still popular for server-side PDF generation.


Node wrappers: wkhtmltopdf, node-wkhtmltopdf.


4) PrinceXML / DocRaptor (paid services)


Very high-quality print/CSS support (including paged-media features).


Great if you need professional, consistent output at scale.


Quick guidance (which should you pick?)


Need the PDF to look exactly like the HTML/CSS? → Playwright or Puppeteer


Need something lightweight and you can tolerate CSS limitations? → wkhtmltopdf


Need top-tier print layout features (headers/footers, page rules, etc.) and reliability? → PrinceXML / DocRaptor


If you tell me your environment (Linux/Windows, serverless like Vercel/AWS Lambda, or a normal Node server) and whether you need header/footer, page numbers, margins, 
I’ll point you to the best-fit choice and a minimal working example.
